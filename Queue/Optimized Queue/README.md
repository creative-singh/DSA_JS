# Optimized Queue

  - Finer Version of Queue Data Structure
  - Follows FIFO
  
As in static queue, the dequeue() operation is done by `.shift()` which is O(n) i.e., Linear time complexity. We need to implement this by O(1).

Optimized queue does the same.

In optimized queue, we will use object despite of array, to maintain O(1) Linear time complexity.
