# Monotonic Stack

A **Monotonic Stack** is a specialized stack data structure that maintains its elements in 2 orders.
- Increasing Order
- Decreasing Order

## Key Characteristics
1. **Order Maintenance**: The stack maintains a monotonic order (either increasing or decreasing) as elements are pushed or popped.
2. **Efficient Range Queries**: Monotonic stacks are ideal for problems requiring efficient range queries or comparisons.

## Types of Monotonic Stacks
1. **Increasing Monotonic Stack**: Elements are arranged in increasing order.
2. **Decreasing Monotonic Stack**: Elements are arranged in decreasing order.

## Common Operations
1. **Push**: Add an element to the stack while maintaining the monotonic order.
2. **Pop**: Remove elements from the stack to maintain the monotonic order.
3. **Peek**: Retrieve the top element without removing it.

## Applications of Monotonic Stacks
1. **Next Greater Element**: Find the next greater element for each element in an array.
2. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**: Solve problems related to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram.
3. **Trapping Rain Water**: Calculate the amount of trapped rainwater in an elevation map.
4. **Stock Span Problem**: Determine the span of stock prices.

## Complexity
- **Push**: O(1) 
- **Pop**: O(1)
- **Peek**: O(1)

Monotonic stacks are highly efficient for problems involving comparisons and ranges, making them a valuable tool in competitive programming and algorithm design.
